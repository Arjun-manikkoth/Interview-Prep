Process:-

A process is an instance of a running program .js runtime and libuv which is being executed.Process is a global bobject in node js that provides information about , and control over, the current node.js process.
Process has its own memory ,created when node file.js is ran , works independently.Processes communicate through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.
eg:- process.event
     process.pid 

Threads(worker thread):-

Threads is a smaller unit of execution within a process.
Worker threads are used to run heavy computational tasks(sync) without blocking the main thread.
Each worker has its own js heap and event loop 
Worker thread creates a new main thread which works paralelly with seperate instance.
It communicate with the process through messages.
Threads share the same memory space and resources of the process(parent) they belong to.
In Node.js, you can create multiple threads within a process using the worker_threads module.


Child process:- 

Node js can spawn additional process(using child_process) .
they are seperate instances of node js that runs concurrently and communicate with the parent process.
